### Process Map

## MVP
Our site/app's main workflow for a minimum viable product:  
* **Dashboard**
  * Displays a list of files (jobs), their status, and operations performed (or to be performed)
  * User can click into a file to be redirected to spreadsheet view of data
  * If no files available, prompt user to upload a file(csv) to process
    * redirect to spreadsheet view upon success
* **Spreadsheet View**
  * Displays table containing file data (rows and columns with headers)
  * Navigate between sheets of current job/file via sheet menu
* **Operations/Services/Transformations (in Spreadsheet View)**
  * Menu for operations to apply to a sheet (user selects which sheet to apply to)
  * Operations in **Validation and Correction & Enhancement** will be expanded (or removed) as individual services and grouped instead under **Column Operations** or **Comparison Operations**
  * **Sheet Operations**: applies to entire sheet
    * Cleansing(???), Error Detection(???), Normalization(???)
* **Column Operations**: prompt user to select one or two columns
  * Validation (Single Column): results will be number of rows matching (is a number, is a negative number, etc..)
    * Boolean results: outputs one column containing all rows with a True or False
  * Formatting (Single Column) : capitalize first letter of column, strip white space, remove odd symbols, etc...
    * Formatted results: outputs one column containing the formatted rows
  * Math Ops (One or Two Columns): +/-/x/รท column by a number or another column (prompt user to select a second column)
    * Calculated results: outputs one column containing the results of the calculation
* **(IF WE HAVE TIME) Comparison Operations**: applies to one or two columns
  * Number comparison (Single Column): is column less than, greater than, or equal to number
  * String comparison (Single Column): is column equal to string
  * Column comparison (Two Columns): is column less than, greater than, or equal to another column  (prompt user to select a second column)
  * All boolean results: outputs one column containing all rows with a True or False
* **(LATER IMPLEMENTATION FOR CHAINING) Conditional Operations**: If user wants to execute an operation depending on the comparison results, user must set a threshold, true Conditional Operation, and a false Conditional Operation for the number of rows that match the condition (or a percentage of rows)
  * Conditional Operations can be any operation that's NOT a Comparison Operation
  * make sure user is prompted for all sheet/column selections for the true and false condition operations
  * Auto executes one or the other depending on threshold and outputs its respective results
* **Results**
  * A new sheet will be created with the results which can be navigated to via sheet menu
    * If not a sheet operation, it should only have one column
    * User can perform operations to include this new column
  * Individual sheets can be exported as csv files
  * (LATER IMPLEMENTATION) All sheets can be exported
  * (LATER IMPLEMENTATION) All operations can be imported to another file to execute the same ops in the same order

### *Definitions*
---

**FileStatus** represents the status of an uploaded file.

   FileStatus | Value | Definition
   --- |---|---
   INACTIVE | 0 | No jobs (operations/services) are running
   QUEUED | 1 | The file is queued to run (it will run the next queued job)
   ACTIVE | 2 | A job is currently running from this file; runs until all jobs are completed or an error occurs
   COMPLETED | 3 |All jobs have been completed
   ERROR | 4 | An error occurred during processing
<br/>
 
**JobStatus** represents the status of an individual job (operation on the file).

  JobStatus | Value | Definition
  --- |---|---
  QUEUED | 0 |Ready to run (the file runs the earliest queued job)
  ACTIVE | 1 | The job's operation is currently running
  COMPLETED | 2 | The job has completed and the file data has been updated
  ERROR | 3 | An error occurred during the job, and the file data was updated
<br/>

**OperationType** defines the type of operation to perform on file data.
 *NOT IMPLEMENTED*
   OperationType | Value | Definition
   --- |---|---
   VALIDATE | 0 | Appends a single column of boolean results (e.g., checks integer validity, nulls, etc.)
   APPLY | 1 | Replaces values (e.g., replace columns, remove rows, fill zeroes)
   CALCULATE | 2 | Appends a column of calculated results (e.g., sum, concatenate)
<br/>

**ComparisonOperator** defines operators used for comparing column selections to values or another columns.
 *NOT IMPLEMENTED*
   ComparisonOperator | Value | Definition
   --- |---|---
   NONE | 0 | No comparison operator is applied
   GREATER_THAN | 1 | >
   LESS_THAN | 2 | <
   EQUAL_TO | 3 | ==
   NOT_EQUAL_TO | 4 | !=
   IN_ARRAY | 5 | Check if value is in an array
   NOT_IN_ARRAY | 6 | Check if value is not in an array
<br/>

### *Models*
---

**File** represents an uploaded file and holds both the file data and its associated job IDs.
  Key | Type | Description
  --- |---|---
  id | number | Auto-generated unique identifier for the file
  user | number | ID of the user who uploaded the file
  file_name | string | Name of the file
  created | string | ISO timestamp when the file was uploaded
  data | any | The file's data stored as JSON (e.g., an array of row objects)
  status | FileStatus | Current status of the file (using FileStatus enum)
  updated | string | ISO timestamp of the last update (e.g., after a job completes or errors)
  jobs | Job[] | List of Job s associated with this file (array of Job objects)
  active_job_id? | number *(default: null)* | (Optional) The ID of the currently running job (if any)
<br/>


**Job** represents an operation executed on file data. It includes details about which operation to perform, column selections, and comparison criteria.
  Key | Type | Description
  --- |---|---
